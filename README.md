# NYCDSA_HousePrice_kaggle_comp
The following project was submitted as part of the NYC Data Science Academy (2020 cohort) with the intended purpose of exploring the housing market of Ames, Iowa. Data obtained through Kaggle included 1460 house sales, and over 80 variables describing the property, house, neighborhood, and nature of the sale. Data wrangling techniques, exporatory data anlyysis, and advanced machine learning techniques were utilized to gain key insights into features of the house that significantly contribute to the price of the house. This information may be vital as prospective home sellers look to make upgrades, thus maximizing their return on investment.
